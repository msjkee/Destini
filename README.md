# 🧭 Flutter Destini

**Destini** is an interactive story-driven Flutter application where the user navigates through a series of choices, each leading to a different outcome. Inspired by the classic "Choose Your Own Adventure" books, this app showcases core Flutter concepts in action.

## 📱 Preview

The app starts with a dramatic scenario and guides the user through multiple story paths depending on their decisions. Each choice takes you deeper into a branching storyline — some choices lead to surprising twists, while others might end the journey.
